           I知 John Eric, my new role as one of the Bachelor of Science in Information technology with specialization in game design and development student in DE LA SALLE College of Saint Benilde is I must have to do things on my own and be independent because I知 already in college and I知 sure there are so many things I will have to face like problems in my subjects, projects, assignments, activities and exams, unlike in high school its not so very hard to pass and graduate. Therefore, stress is always there .To conquer that I will have to lessen my time in playing basketball, computer games, chess and guitar. I must wake up early so that I will not miss my classes .I must focus on my studies and as a GDD student I must improve my computer skills, be a creative student and must widen my imagination skills. In college, I will have new relationships. Relationship with my new environment, my block mates ,and faculty and staff, because they are the one whom I will be with when I知 in college or  after I graduate .My new assumptions are, I think I知 going to sleep less than eight hours because of the activities that i will do .I will meet new friends and new teachers. I will encounter more problems that would turn to stress .But in exchange of those things; I will be a creative and one of the productive members of the society that will help in our country and the game industry.
